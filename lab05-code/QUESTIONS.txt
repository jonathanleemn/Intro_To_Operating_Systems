PROBLEM 1 `dirops.c'
====================

A
~

  Examine the source code of `dirops.c' closely. It makes use of a
  variety of system calls to produce a semi-interesting effect.  Compile
  and run it several times. Describe the overall intent of the program
  based on its output and the code you understand.


Solution                                                      :solution:
--------

  `dirops.c' scans the current directory to find the largest file in the
  current directory and makes a copy of it to the file name
  `file.txt.copy' if `file.txt' is the largest file.


B
~

  What set of system calls is used by the program to determine all the
  files in the current directory? Describe briefly how these calls work
  together.


Solution                                                      :solution:
--------

  `diropen()' opens a directory and allows successive calls to
  `readdir()' to produce entries in the directory. These are stored in a
  `struct dirent' which has fields such as the name of the file.


C
~

  Identify the system call that `dirops.c' uses to find the sizes of
  files. Describe briefly how this call works.


Solution                                                      :solution:
--------

  `stat()' is used for sizes: given a name, it populates a `struct stat'
  which has a field `st_size' which gives the size in bytes of the file.


D
~

  The following line sets up the read/write permissions that the copied
  file will have.
  ,----
  | mode_t perms = S_IRUSR | S_IWUSR;
  `----
  Modify this line so that the copied file is readable by the group as
  well as the user.

  /Optional challenge:/ Set the permissions to be identical to the
  original file. `stat()' is one way to find out the permissions for the
  original file.


Solution                                                      :solution:
--------

  ,----
  | mode_t perms = S_IRUSR | S_IWUSR | S_IRGRP;
  | 
  | // Optional: set the permissions to be identical to the original file
  | stat(max_name, &sb);
  | perms = sb.st_mode;
  `----


E
~

  `dirops.c' contains a subtle bug in the following bit of code towards
  the end of the file.
  ,----
  |   while( (nbytes = read(infd, buf, BUFSIZE)) > 0){
  |     write(outfd, buf, BUFSIZE);
  |   }
  `----
  You should observe that every time program is run, it will identify a
  copied file as the largest and make another copy due to this bug. It
  may help to examine the ends of the copied files with the `tail
  file.txt.copy' command which will show the last 10 lines.

  Explain what is wrong with the loop and paste a fixed version below.


Solution                                                      :solution:
--------

  The loop incorrectly writes the `BUFSIZE' every time. This may append
  extra data to the end of the file in the event that fewer bytes are
  read() in than the `BUFSIZE'.  Writing `nbytes' will guarantee that no
  more bytes are written than are read. This will result in an identical
  size of the copy.
  ,----
  |   while( (nbytes = read(infd, buf, BUFSIZE)) > 0){   // read until no bytes left
  |     write(outfd, buf, nbytes);                       // correct write
  |     // write(outfd, buf, BUFSIZE);                      // buggy write to outfd
  |   }
  `----
